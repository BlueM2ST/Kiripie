Kiripie VN Tool Version 0.6.1

This document will attempt to explain some features of the tool.
It will not cover everything as many of the GUI tags are still being worked on.

Please use Godot 3.0 with this tool. No attempt will be made to make this work with Godot 2.x or earlier.


# Process

There are three types of files:
-kpcf
-kp
-kpd

The *.kpcf file will be parsed as the game is executed. It defines the GUI elements of the game. This will be explained later on.

The *.kpd file(s) contain dialogue and localization information. You might not want to use this file until version 1.0 as there are bugs.

The *.kp files(s) contain the information for the game to run such as sprites, backgrounds, character names, etc.
