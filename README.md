# SiennaScripter

Scripting language for making story-based games, dialogues, branching stories, and visual novels.

Inspired by the scripts used by Kirikiri, this easy-to-use scripting system is designed to fit any sort of dialogue needs.


# How do I use it?

Following in the footsteps of Kirikiri (it was actually initially designed to port Kirikiri games), games are developed in a separate script file with a tag-based scripting language designed to be edited in a text editor.

However, the entire game does not need to be created with SiennaScripter (although it's possible to do so).

Instead, you can simply add the SiennaScripter scene to your game and remove it when you are finished with it.
